Screen-Blanket
==============

Screen Blanket is a simple application that throws up a full screen single colour panel that is useful for blanking out a monitor display if needed. For example, Screen Blanket could be used when watching output on a secondary display and not wanting the first monitor to distract one's attention.  Created by Craig Lotter, May 2005
